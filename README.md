# The-Number-Guess-Game
The Number Guessing Game is a fun Python Tkinter project where the computer picks a random number, and the player guesses it. The game provides hints like “Too high” or “Too low,” counts attempts, and shows the best score. It features a light blue theme and an easy, interactive interface for players.
